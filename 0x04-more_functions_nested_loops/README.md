# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

0. 0-isupper.c - a function that checks for uppercase character
	* Prototype: int _isupper(int c);
	* Returns 1 if c is uppercase
	* Returns 0 otherwise
1. 1-isdigit.c - a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
	* Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
	* Returns 1 if c is a digit
	* Returns 0 otherwise
2. 2-mul.c - a function that multiplies two integers
3. 3-print_numbers.c - a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line
4. 4-print_most_numbers.c - a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line
5. 5-more_numbers.c - a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line
6. 6-print_line.c - a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
	* Prototype: void print_line(int n);_
	* You can only use _putchar function to print
	* Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed
	* The line should end with a \n
	* If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n
