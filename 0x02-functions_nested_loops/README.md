# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

0. 0-putchar.c - a program that prints __putchar, followed by a new line. The program should return 0
1. 1-alphabet.c - a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line
2. 2-print_alphabet_x10.c - a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line
3. 3-islower.c - a function that checks for lowercase character
4. 4-isalpha.c - a function that checks for alphabetic character. Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase. Returns 0 otherwise
5. 5-sign.c - a function that prints the sign of a number.
	* Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
	* Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
	* Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
	* Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero_
6. 6-abs.c - a function that computes the absolute value of an integer
7. 7-print_last_digit.c - a function that prints the last digit of a number
8. 8-24_hours.c - a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59._
9. 9-times_table.c - a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0_
10. 10-add.c - a function that adds two integers and returns the result
11. 11-print_to_98.c - a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
	* Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
	* Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
	* Numbers should be printed in order
	* The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
	* The last printed number should be 98
	* You are allowed to use the standard library
12. 100-times_table.c - a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0. If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything_
13. 101-natural.c - Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1024 (excluded), followed by a new line.
14. 102-fibonacci.c - a program that prints the first 50 Fibonacci numbers, starting with 1 and 2, followed by a new line.
	* The numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space ,
