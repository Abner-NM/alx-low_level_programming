# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

0. 0-strcat.c - a function that concatenates two strings.
	* This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
	* Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest
1. 1-strncat.c - a function that concatenates two strings
	* it will use at most n bytes from src 
	* src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
	* Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
2. 2-strncpy.c - a function that copies a string
3. 3-strcmp.c - a function that compares two strings
4. 4-rev_array.c - a function that reverses the content of an array of integers
5. 5-string_toupper.c - a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase
6. 6-cap_string.c - a function that capitalizes all words of a string
	* Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }
7. 7-leet.c - a function that encodes a string into 1337.
	* Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
	* Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
	* Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
	* Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
	* Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
	* Prototype: char *leet(char *);
