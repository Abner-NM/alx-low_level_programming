# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

0. 0-strcat.c - a function that concatenates two strings.
	* This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte
	* Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest
1. 1-strncat.c - a function that concatenates two strings
	* it will use at most n bytes from src 
	* src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
	* Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
2. 2-strncpy.c - a function that copies a string
3. 3-strcmp.c - a function that compares two strings
4. 4-rev_array.c - a function that reverses the content of an array of integers
5. 5-string_toupper.c - a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase
6. 6-cap_string.c - a function that capitalizes all words of a string
	* Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }
7. 7-leet.c - a function that encodes a string into 1337.
	* Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
	* Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
	* Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
	* Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
	* Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
	* Prototype: char *leet(char *);
	* You can only use one if in your code
	* You can only use two loops in your code
	* You are not allowed to use switch
	* You are not allowed to use any ternary operation
8. 100-rot13.c - a function that encodes a string using rot13
	* You can only use if statement once in your code
	* You can only use two loops in your code
	* You are not allowed to use switch
	* You are not allowed to use any ternary operation
9. 101-print_number.c - a function that prints an integer
	* You can only use _putchar function to print
	* You are not allowed to use long
	* You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers
	* You are not allowed to hard-code special values_
10. 102-magic.c - Add one line to [this code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/make_magic_happen/blob/master/magic.c), so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line
	* You are not allowed to use the variable a in your new line of code
	* You are not allowed to modify the variable p
	* You can only write one statement
	* You are not allowed to use ,
	* You are not allowed to code anything else than the line of expected line of code at the expected line
	* Your code should be written at line 19, before the ;
	* Do not remove anything from the initial code (not even the comments)
	* and don’t change anything but the line of code you are adding (don’t change the spaces to tabs!)
